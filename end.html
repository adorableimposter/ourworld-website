Hey, hope you are doing well. Its been a long time since we talked, well
you know all the stuff we've been through the past few months.Not a day goes
    by wherein i dont think about you,how we would still be together if things
    didint happen the way it did.But now i realise how much important it is for 
    us to stay apart from each other.It is hard passing every single day knowing
    that i can't message you, i cant hear your voice more than anything see you
    ever again but I'll have to learn to live with it.I can't express how grateful 
    I am for the love and joy you brought into my life. I'm truly luck to have spend
    the last 3 years of my life with you and believe me when i say that those were 
    the best years of my life.
         
    Well shit your'e 19 now oficially at the end of your teenage im sure youre
    gonna have an amazing year ahead . You get only one life right? Make the most 
    amazing memories out of it.I'll always be here if you ever need me.If you ever
    feel lost look within yourself for the answer to every problem lies within you.
